Field Schemata
==============

There are several places in the schemaeditor where we need to complete
and or improve on the schema provided by field instances in order to
fully support the field edit forms.

The schema used on an edit form for a field is retrieved by looking up
an adapter on the field which provides IEditFormFieldSchema.  The
default/fallback adapter introspects the interfaces provided by the
file looking for the first which is or extends
zope.schema.interfaces.IField.

    >>> from zope import schema
    >>> from plone.schemaeditor import interfaces
    >>> field = schema.Field()
    >>> interfaces.IEditFormFieldSchema(field)
    <InterfaceClass zope.schema.interfaces.IField>
